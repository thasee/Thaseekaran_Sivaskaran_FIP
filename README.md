# Challenges Faced

This project was quite challenging and memorable for me. I encountered difficulties during the design phase, but my coding skills were proficient. I sought advice from mentors to overcome some informational hurdles. I gave my best effort throughout and encountered challenges with version control, which I resolved with the help of YouTube tutorials. I remained dedicated until the very end, ensuring I put in my best effort.
