            Algonquin Park, the first provincial park in Ontario, protected from
            the noise and rush of civilization, this world-renowned park in
            Ontario is a sanctuary for the rugged beauty of the maple, pine,
            moose, and wolves. A Provincial Park since1893, the 7500 square
            kilometers (3500 square miles) of Algonquin Park are home to a
            diverse and unblemished eco-system that can be found nowhere else on
            earth.
          </p>

          <p>
            Glaciers that receded ten thousand years ago created the distinctive
            rock outcroppings and spring-fed lakes of Algonquin. These mountains
            of ice have left the park with a rough, stark beauty. This, combined
            with its location, 3 hours northeast of Toronto and 2 1/2 hours west
            of Ottawa makes Algonquin an ideal attraction for those looking to
            escape the hustle of the city.
          </p>

          <p>
            This majestic park, minutes away and seen from our lakeshore, is
            awe-inspiring and completely peaceful with the incredible beauty of
            nature. Come experience the Algonquin grandeur, with all its fresh
            clean air, deep blue skies, rich green forests and hundreds of
            pristine lakes. It is impressive.
          </p>

          <p>

          <p>
            Couples resort is located on the shores of Galeairy Lake, with
            direct access to Algonquin Park. Originally named Long lake which
            was renamed to Galeairy Lake because the lake borders Nightengale
            and Airy townships.
          </p>

          <p>
            Galeairy Lake is 11 kilometres (7 miles) long, land locked and
            extends mostly inside the boundaries of Algonquin Park. Explore the
            many secluded coves by canoe or kayak and search for loons, beaver,
            otter and moose. Pull up on shore, have a picnic and go for a swim.
          </p>

          <p>
            Swimming in this lake is great. It is very clean and safe, with
            water temperatures hitting 25C (78F) by the end of July. Typically
            the lake temperature is above 18C (70F) from the third week of June
            to the first week of September.
